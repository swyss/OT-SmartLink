# Non-Functional Requirements

## Performance
- Response times for data queries should be <1 second.
- The system should handle up to 10,000 sensor updates per second.

## Scalability
- System should scale horizontally to handle increased sensor data.
- Ability to add more storage nodes as needed.

## Availability
- 99.9% uptime required for critical services.
- Failover mechanisms in place for key modules.

## Security
- All communication must be encrypted (e.g., TLS for REST, OPC UA security).
