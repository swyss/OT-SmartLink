# Risk Analysis

## Identified Risks
1. **Hardware Incompatibility**: Devices may not fully support OPC UA/DA standards.
2. **Data Loss**: Risk of data loss during high-frequency data transfers.
3. **Security Breaches**: Vulnerabilities in data transmission.

## Mitigation Strategies
- Thorough testing of all devices before deployment.
- Implement redundant storage mechanisms.
- Regular security audits.
